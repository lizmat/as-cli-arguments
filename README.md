NAME
====

as-cli-arguments - stringify a Capture as command-line arguments

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use as-cli-arguments;
sub MAIN(|c) { say as-cli-arguments c, :named-anywhere }
```

```raku
use as-cli-arguments;
my %*SUB-MAIN-OPTS = :named-anywhere;
sub MAIN(|c) { say as-cli-arguments c }

sub MAIN(*@pos, :$foo, :$bar, *%_) {
    die "Found unexpected named arguments: &as-cli-arguments(%_)"
      if %_;
}
```

```raku
say as-cli-arguments { :42a, :666b }  # --a=42 --b=666

say as-cli-arguments "a" => 42;       # --a=42
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

as-cli-arguments exports a single subroutine `as-cli-arguments` that takes either a `Capture` object, a hash with named arguments, or a `Pair` and returns a string that represents the contents of the argument given as if it were command line arguments.

If a `Capture` object is specified, then the subroutine also takes an optional named arguments `:named-anywhere` to indicate whether or not the "named arguments anywhere" mode should be assumed. By default, this will use the `%*SUB-MAIN-OPTS<named-anywhere>` setting, if available. Else it will default to `False`.

This is mainly intended as a helper subroutine for command-line scripts and modules that want to give feedback about the given or perceived or unexpected command line parameters.
