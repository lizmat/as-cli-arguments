as-cli-arguments - stringify a Capture as command-line arguments

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use as-cli-arguments;
sub MAIN(|c) { say as-cli-arguments c, :named-anywhere }

=end code

=begin code :lang<raku>

use as-cli-arguments;
my %*SUB-MAIN-OPTS = :named-anywhere;
sub MAIN(|c) { say as-cli-arguments c }

sub MAIN(*@pos, :$foo, :$bar, *%_) {
    die "Found unexpected named arguments: &as-cli-arguments(%_)"
      if %_;
}

=end code

=begin code :lang<raku>

say as-cli-arguments { :42a, :666b }  # --a=42 --b=666

say as-cli-arguments (:42a, :666b)    # --a=42 --b=666

say as-cli-arguments "a" => 42;       # --a=42

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<as-cli-arguments> distrubution exports a single subroutine
C<as-cli-arguments> that takes either a C<Capture> object, a hash
with named arguments, a C<Pair> or a list of C<Pair>s and returns
a string that represents the contents of the argument given as if
they were command line arguments.

If a C<Capture> object is specified, then the subroutine also takes
an optional named arguments C<:named-anywhere> to indicate whether or
not the "named arguments anywhere" mode should be assumed.  By default,
this will use the C<%*SUB-MAIN-OPTS<named-anywhere>> setting, if
available.  Else it will default to C<False>.

This is mainly intended as a helper subroutine for command-line scripts
and modules that want to give feedback about the given or perceived or
unexpected command line parameters.
